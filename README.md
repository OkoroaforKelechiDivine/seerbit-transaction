# seerbit-transaction
Requirements
These are the additional requirements for the solution:

- You are free to choose any JVM language to complete the challenge in, but your application has to run in Maven.
- The API has to be thread-safe with concurrent requests.
- The POST /transactions and GET /statistics endpoints MUST execute in constant time and memory ie O(1). Scheduled cleanup is not sufficient
- The solution has to work without a database (this also applies to in-memory databases).
- Unit tests are mandatory.
- mvn clean install and mvn clean integration-test must complete successfully.
- Please ensure that no changes are made to the src/it folder.
- In addition to passing the tests, the solution must be at a quality level that you would be comfortable enough to put in production.


Problem challenge
We would like to have a REST API for our statistics. The main use case for the API is to calculate realtime statistics for the last 30 seconds of transactions. The API needs the following endpoints:

- POST /transactions – called every time a transaction is made.
- GET /statistics – returns the statistic based of the transactions of the last 30 seconds.
- DELETE /transactions – deletes all transactions.

1. POST /transactions
This endpoint is called to create a new transaction. It MUST execute in constant time and memory (O(1)).

Body:

{
"amount": "12.3343",
"timestamp": "2022-06-17T09:59:51.312Z"
}

Where:

- amount – transaction amount; a string of arbitrary length that is parsable as a BigDecimal
- timestamp – transaction time in the ISO 8601 format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ in the UTC timezone (this is not the current timestamp)
- Returns: Empty body with one of the following:

- 201 – in case of success
- 204 – if the transaction is older than 30 seconds
- 400 – if the JSON is invalid
- 422 – if any of the fields are not parsable or the transaction date is in the future
